"question": "A die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 3?",
"options": ["1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
"answerIndex": 3,
"explanation": "The numbers greater than 3 on a die are 4, 5, and 6. Since there are six equally likely outcomes, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2."

"question": "A bag contains 3 red balls and 2 green balls. If a ball is drawn at random from the bag, what is the probability of getting a green ball?",
"options": ["1/5", "2/5", "1/3", "2/3"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "There are a total of 5 balls in the bag, out of which 2 are green. Therefore, the probability of getting a green ball is 2/5."

"question": "Two cards are drawn at random from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that both cards are aces?",
"options": ["1/169", "1/221", "1/273", "1/325"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The probability of drawing an ace from a deck of 52 cards is 4/52. Since there are 4 aces in a deck, the probability of drawing two aces in a row is (4/52) * (3/51) = 1/169."

"question": "A coin is flipped 4 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?",
"options": ["1/2", "3/8", "1/4", "1/8"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The probability of getting a head on one flip of a coin is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 4 flips is (4 choose 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 = 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25."

"options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "There are 26 cards that are either a heart or a diamond in a deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of getting a heart or a diamond is 26/52 = 1/2."
